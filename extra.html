            <p>
                Welcome to the extra resources page. My website simply will never be capable of teaching everything the curious mind is capable of handling. On this page will be 
                a series of links to websites and videos that have grown my interest in various STEM related subjects. You don't have to use any of these sources, and they may not be 
                perfect, but they should be useful should you want to learn more.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Mathematics</h2>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Websites</b></p>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> - This is an educational website that teaches all kinds of subjects. This is a wonderful website to 
            learn mathematics as it has plenty of videos and excersises to learn from.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Youtube Channels</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a> - 3Blue1Brown provides videos on mathematics with the goal of building 
                mathematical intuition rather than memorization of formulas and such. His videos are extremely useful for anyone who is interested in mathematics</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile">Numberphile</a> - Numberphile is a channel that talks about a wide variety of mathematical subjects with 
                many different speakers. Almost everything talked about on this channel is beginner friendly and is rather entertaining even when speaking about subjects that are 
                more fun than useful.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths">Stand-up Maths</a> - Stand-up maths is a channel that talks about random mathematical subjects in a often 
                humorous manner. While information from this channel may not help you in class, it is very fun to watch.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Computer Science</h2>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Websites</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> - Khan Academy provides educational resources for many subjects including computer science. 
                It may not be incredibly expansive on computer science information, but it is great for beginners</li>
                <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - Stack Overflow is a forum for computer science questions. If you have a question about computer 
                science, someone else probably asked it already and has an answer. </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> - Github isn't an educational platform, but it is essential in developing software, especially if you are working 
                in a team. This website is hosted by Github completely for free as well.</li>
                <li><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=engineering&subcat=computerscience">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> - MIT hosts their lectures, notes, and 
                assignments all for free online. This may be a difficult source to use, but it provides free college level education.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Youtube Channels</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEBb1b_L6zDS3xTUrIALZOw">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> - MIT OpenCourseWare was mentioned above but they also have a youtube 
                channel that contains their lectures. I would recommend viewing the playlist "mathematics for computer science".</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile">Numberphile</a> - This channel is very similar to numberphile but talks about computer science instead.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh/videos">CaryKH</a> - This channel isn't as educational as it is entertaining. Often he will create programs related 
                to neural networks, though he has many kinds of projects that are fun to watch.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA">Javidx9</a> - This channel is mostly about C++ programming. These videos can be rather long and 
                dense with information but may be useful if you intend on developing in C++.</li>
            </ul>
