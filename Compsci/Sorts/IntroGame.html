                Hello, and welcome to the sorting algorithms section. First, we should begin with a simple game. Try to devise a plan and win this game with
                as few moves as possible.
            </p>

            <p> 
                A question you may have is why we should learn about sorting algorithms. In our age of information, often there is a lot
                of data in one place, and being able to find certain information is incredibly important. If data is stored haphazardly, it can be rather difficult
                to find what you are looking for. If the data is properly sorted, however, searching through it is much easier. Sorting algorithms are often some of 
                the first algorithms a computer science student is exposed to due to the various levels of difficulty these algorithms yield. Something like bubblesort 
                is both relatively easy to write and understand while performing a useable task.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Through learning about these algorithms you will learn about optimization and how to determine the complexity of an algorithm. You will also be exposed 
                to many computer science concepts that are useful in the creation of many other complex algorithms.
