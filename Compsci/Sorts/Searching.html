                The game above is a simple guessing game. Either you or the computer will pick a random number between 1-100 and the opponent will have to guess. The only clue that can 
                be given is whether the number is greater than or less than this value. Try to develop a plan to win in the fewest moves, or analyze how the computer guesses your number.

                One day you find yourself required to read a book for a school assignment when an unfamilliar threat presents itself: the word '<b>taciturn</b>'. As a fellow of the 
                modern world your first thought may be to use the wonderful resource known as google to find the answer. However, the archaic return to phyiscal reading reminds you of 
                a simpler time where mankind relied on a heavyweight device known as a dictionary to discover the meaning of various words. You remember you have one lying around... 
                but this is no ordinary dictionary. It is named the dicetionary.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Upon opening this primitive lexicon, an odd pattern emerges. The first defined word is 'provincial' followed by 'sweep'. A few words later you see 'vegetarian' and 
                even a word you don't even feel comfortable attempting to pronounce. It looks like the words were chosen by the roll of a die. The word you are looking for is in this 
                book, but it could be the 10th, 15th, 100th, or final word. Determined, you decide to look through each word one by one until you find your particular word. With over 
                170,000 words in the english dictionary, this may take a while.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Suddenly you realize that you had actually fallen asleep and that you dreamt of such a book. It turns out reading is a rather tiresome task. In a real dictionary, words 
                are sorted by alphabetical order (hopefully you remember your ABC's). Armed with this knowledge, you open the book halfway through and observe the first word. If the word 
                you are looking for comes after, you look halfway between here and the end. Otherwise you look halfway through the first half. You repeat this process, slowly getting closer to 
                the answer until you find it: '<b>taciturn</b>'. Looks like it means, "(of a person) reserved or uncommunicative in speech; saying little".
            </p>

            <p> 
                <b>TL;DR</b> When you need to look through a lot of data, it is better that it is ordered than random. Sorted data can be searched quickly, unsorted data requires looking 
                one by one through your data.
