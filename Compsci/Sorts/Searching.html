                The game above is a simple guessing game. Either you or the computer will pick a random number between 1-100 and the opponent will have to guess. The only clue that can 
                be given is whether the number is greater than or less than this value. Try to develop a plan to win in the fewest moves, or analyze how the computer guesses your number.

                One day you find yourself required to read a book for a school assignment when an unfamilliar threat presents itself: the word '<b>taciturn</b>'. As a fellow of the 
                modern world your first thought may be to use the wonderful resource known as google to find the answer. However, the archaic return to phyiscal reading reminds you of 
                a simpler time where mankind relied on a heavyweight device known as a dictionary to discover the meaning of various words. You remember you have one lying around... 
                but this is no ordinary dictionary. It is named the dicetionary.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Upon opening this primitive lexicon, an odd pattern emerges. The first defined word is 'provincial' followed by 'sweep'. A few words later you see 'vegetarian' and 
                even a word you don't even feel comfortable attempting to pronounce. It looks like the words were chosen by the roll of a die. The word you are looking for is in this 
                book, but it could be the 10th, 15th, 100th, or final word. Determined, you decide to look through each word one by one until you find your particular word. With over 
                170,000 words in the english dictionary, this may take a while.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Suddenly you realize that you had actually fallen asleep and that you dreamt of such a book. It turns out reading is a rather tiresome task. In a real dictionary, words 
                are sorted by alphabetical order (hopefully you remember your ABC's). Armed with this knowledge, you open the book halfway through and observe the first word. If the word 
                you are looking for comes after, you look halfway between here and the end. Otherwise you look halfway through the first half. You repeat this process, slowly getting closer to 
                the answer until you find it: '<b>taciturn</b>'. Looks like it means, "(of a person) reserved or uncommunicative in speech; saying little".
            </p>

            <p> 
                <b>TL;DR</b> When you need to look through a lot of data, it is better that it is ordered than random. Sorted data can be searched quickly, unsorted data requires looking 
                one by one through your data.
            </p>

            <p> 
                In the next section, we will talk about implementing searching algorithms.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Implementing Searching Algorithms </h1>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Linear Search </h2>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p>
                Assuming your data is unsorted and the data structure you are using has an ordered structure (ex. an array rather than a dictionary) then the only real way to 
                find the position of a value is through a linear search. This means looking through each element one by one until you find a match. Such a search takes O(n) time 
                complexity. Implementing this is rather straightforward and an example of psuedocode will be provided below.
            </p>
        </div>

        <pre>
            <code>
    function linear_search(array, value) {

        // a simple loop that traverses the whole array.
        for (int i = 0; i < array.size; i++) {

            // Once the searched value is found, the index is returned.
            if (array[i] == value) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        // In order to reach this line of code, the previous loop must not have
        // found the value requested. The value -1 indicates the value was not found.
        return -1;
    }
            </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Binary Search </h2>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p> 
                If, instead, an ordered data structure is also sorted, then we can use binary search to more quickly find the value we want. This procedure also requires that 
                the objects in the data structure can be compared. We start with storing the lowest index (which starts at index 0) and the highest index in the array. We select 
                the middle value and if it matches the searched value then we return this index. If the searched value is lower than this value, we repeat this process on the lower 
                half by setting the maximum index to this middle index. If the searched value is higher then we do the same thing but with setting the minimum index to this value. We 
                repeat this process until we find the searched value or the range of values is zero indicating that the searched value does not exist (in which case we return -1).
            </p>

            <p>
                Each step of this process splits the array in half, eliminating those values from being compared. When implemented effectively, this has a time complexity of 
                O(log(n)) as the maximum number of comparisons only really increases when the size of the array doubles. A psuedocode implementation will be provided below.
            </p>
        </div>

        <pre>
            <code>
    function binary_search(sorted_array, value) {
        // We store the lowest, highest, and middle index
        min_index = 0;
        max_index = sorted_array.size;
        midpoint;

        // If min_index is greater than max_index it means the value we are looking for doesn't exist.
        while (min_index <= max_index) {

            // We write floor here, but really the value must be an integer. In most programming languages
            // You can do integer division or set the data type to integer.
            midpoint = floor((min_index + max_index)/2);

            // If the middle value is the proper value, we just return it.
            if sorted_array[midpoint] {
                return sorted_array[midpoint];

            } elseif value > sorted_array[midpoint] {

                // Here we set the minimum index to the midpoint and add one to limit the possible indexes 
                // to the upper half excluding the previous middle value.
                min_index = midpoint + 1;
            } else {

                // Same as the last line but for the lower half
                max_index = midpoint - 1;
            }
        }

        // Value does not exist in the array
        return -1;
    }
            </code>
        </pre>

                This psuedocode utilizes an iterative approach to this sort, but a recursive implementation may be effective as well. Keep in mind that however you implement 
                an algorithm depends on what you are using it on and what your design goals are.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Miscellaneous Information </h2>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p>
                Now you should know more about how to implement sorting algorithms and search algorithms for your future endeavors. While it is useful to learn this information to 
                understand what works best for your projects, often the code you need has already been written for the language you are using (such as in a library or from stackoverflow).
            </p>

            <p>
                Something to keep in mind is that while binary sort is faster with sorted data, you may not need it for a certain environment. For instance, if you are only doing one search 
                on data that is difficult to maintain order, then it is actually more inefficient to sort the data then search. This is because a linear search takes O(n) time while sorting 
                often has the best average time of O(n log n). If you need to know the position of multiple values then it may be important to sort the data first.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, if you just need to determine if a value exists in a set of values that doesn't need to be ordered, you may wish to use a hash table. An ideal hash table 
                has a lookup time of O(1). If you'd like to learn more about hash tables, <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/hash_data_structure.htm">click here</a> 
                or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/"> click here</a>. Other data structures such as search trees and linked lists may have other searching methods. 
                I highly recommend that you look into all kinds of data structures if you have a curious mind.
