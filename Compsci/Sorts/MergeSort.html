            Next, we should talk about merge sort.
            </p>

            <ol> 
                <li>If there is only one element in this array, we stop</li>
                <li>We split the array into two seperate halves and run this algorithm on the new halves</li>
                <li>A new array is created where we will recombine the two halves</li>
                <li>The first value in both arrays is compared and the smaller value is moved to the end of the new array</li>
                <li>The previous step is repeated until all elements in both halves are combined</li>               
            </ol>

            <p> 
            Again, this algorithm utilizes recursion very effectively. While the steps in this process were written in one list, in reality there are two seperate processes. 
            One process splits the array into small pieces and the other merges them back together.

            Both of these algorithms on average have a time complexity of O(n log n), which is significantly better than all of the aforementioned sorts. An important question then 
            is which algorithm should be used for a given dataset? The answer to this question can differ based upon what data you are sorting. Quicksort at its worst can take as 
            long as bubblesort in terms of time complexity. Mergesort, however, requires the use of extra memory which could be problematic if the device being used has limited space. 
            In certain circumstances and in particular for large datasets, there are actually algorithms even faster than these two. Those will be covered in the next section.

        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Miscellaneous Sorts </h1>

        <div class="explanation"> 
            <p>  
            At last, we will discuss Bucket Sort. In theory, this algorithm can have a time complexity of O(n + k). That means for incredibly large datasets, this algorithm will have 
            a linear growth in time. In order to effectively utilize this sort, the data should be uniformly distributed.
            </p>

            <p>
            We first create a certain number of "buckets" based on the range of elements in our dataset. Each of these buckets is filled with values within certain ranges.  
            </p>

            <p>
            For instance, if we have data ranging from 0-100, we may make 10 "buckets". The first value would take values from 0-9, the second from 10-19, the third from 20-29, etc. 
            </p>

            <p>
            In each bucket we sort them using some other sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or insertion sort. Once all buckets are sorted, they are combined back together in order.
            </p>

            <p> 
            Of course there are other non-comparison sorts like radix sort, counting sort, and much more. If you are curious, I advise you to do research into them. It may seem that 
            these algorithms are incredible, but they have a major downside. Depending on the kind of data, that value for k could be incredibly high. This means that for some datasets, 
            even bubblesort would be a better alternative. These algorithms may also have memory requirements that may not be optimal for the machine doing the sorting. 
            They also have certain prerequisites for their functionality at all. Ultimately, you must consider what kind of data and machine you have and use the best algorithm 
            for that situation.

            <p>
            There are countless algorithms to learn about, and if you have a particularly curious mind you may want to learn more. The list provided below could be useful, as these 
            websites have been really useful for me.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a> - this website has all kinds of computer science information, and their explanations are rather good.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa">Programiz</a> - similar to GeeksforGeeks, this website has great explanations, graphs, and code examples in various languages.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sorting-algorithms-explained-with-examples-in-python-java-and-c/">FreeCodeCamp</a> - again, another great computer science resource.</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm">Wikipedia</a> - you may not be able to use this source for a research paper, but it is still useful. The content on wikipedia 
                can be rather dense and hard to read, but it excels at giving a multitude of links to various computer science topics</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg">A Fun Video</a> - this video shows various algorithms in action. It is rather mesmorizing, but be warned that if you use Youtube you will be recommended countless other similar videos.</li>
