            Hello, and welcome to the page about sorting algorithms. First, we should begin with a simple game. Try to devise a plan and win this game with
            as few moves as possible. A question you may have is why we should learn about sorting algorithms. In our age of information, often there is a lot
            of data in one place, and being able to find certain information is incredibly important. If data is stored haphazardly, it can be rather difficult
            to find what you are looking for. If the data is properly sorted, however, searching through it is much easier. Sorting algorithms are often some of 
            the first algorithms a computer science student is exposed to due to the various levels of difficulty these algorithms yield. Something like bubblesort 
            is both relatively easy to write and understand while performing a useable task. Something like heapsort, however, is relatively more complex and utilizes more 
            computer science principles. The following pages will show various algorithms and how they are implemented.
