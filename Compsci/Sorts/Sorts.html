        <p> 
            Welcome to the world of sorting algorithms! 
            There are quite a number of times in computer science where a lot of data will be collected. 
            Searching through scattered data can be computationally intensive and messy, so the data will often be sorted by some means.
            If words were random in a dictionary, for instance, it would be nearly impossible to find the word you are searching for.
            There are many ways to sort data that will soon be covered with different upsides and downsides.
            Most that will be covered are called comparison sorts, as they compare two elements at a time and make swaps if necessary.
            If you haven't been exposed to any sorting algorithms before, try to devise a plan yourself using the game posted above.
