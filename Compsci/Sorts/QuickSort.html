            After looking at the past sorting algorithms, the common issue is that they are really quite slow and inefficient. These two sorts utilize a different technique 
            with the aim of efficiency. They utilize a "divide and conquer" method for their sorts. These algorithms break the unsorted data into smaller and smaller chunks that 
            are more easy to sort. These sorting algorithms combine these smaller chunks together then uses the same method of sorting again. Ultimately this has the effect of minimizing 
            comparisons in a dataset and thus improving efficiency.

            First, we should talk about quick sort.
            </p>

            <ol> 
                <li> If there are no elements in this array, we are finished</li>
                <li> We pick a "pivot" in the array. This could be the first, middle, final, or a random position in the array</li>
                <li> All values are compared to this value. The smaller values go to the left of the pivot and greater values to the right</li>
                <li> Repeat steps 1-3 for the segement of the array to the left of the pivot and the segment to the right</li>
            </ol>

            <p> 
            Since this process repeats onto smaller and smaller segments of an array, this algorithm works rather well using recursion. If you are unaware about recursion, that is 
            when an algorithm repeatedly calls itself to complete a task. There must be a base case for this algorithm or else it will continue forever, and for this sort that is when 
            there are no elements in the segment of the array.
